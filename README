# TTS Bot
TTS Bot is a simple Python discord bot that transcribes channels messages as a voice file and reads back to users in a voice channel.

## Installation

Save the TTS-Bot repo and cd into the corresponding dir and execute the following command.

Install the required libraries with
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

Head to [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to set up a new TTS bot.
Be sure to copy the bot token generate with your new app, and create a new .env file and paste in the bot token

Note: The bot is currently unable to work on Heroku services as it relys on sending outbound UDP packets.

## Usage

!joinvoice, joins the user's current voice channel
!leavevoice, leaves the current voice channel
!enableTTS, enables the bot to transcribe all inbound user messages (note: the bot will ignore all messages denoted as a command !)
!disableTTS, disables the TTS-Bot and will no longer transcribe messages until enabled
